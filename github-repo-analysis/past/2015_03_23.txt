no idea what happened in the plugin, so I decided to learn vim instead

vim: 
- normal mode: default, you can return to normal from other states via esp
- insertion mode can be entered in several ways
- visual mode: press v, highlight stuff?

insert mode: A - end of curr, I - start of curr, a - curr_location, o - line below, O - above curr, S - substitute this line

movement in normal: h <-, j down, k up, l ->
w move forward 1 word, b 1 word back
