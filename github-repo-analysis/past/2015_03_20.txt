schema of the photobook:

Photo 
- name
- caption
- data (the image)
- slug 

Url patterns:
- api/(?P<slug>[\S]+)/ calls API_data
returns json of photo object
- api/ calls API_all
returns all photobook in json format
- (?P<slug>[\S]+)/ calls data
same as api/(re^) but views in html 
- ^ calls photobook_all
same as API_all, but displays in html

Comments:
- get_object_or_404 <-- raises 404 instead of does not exist, for api purposes
- pretty basic app that I am familiar with
